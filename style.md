1. You must gofmt your code before any commit. To not forget it, it's best to gofmt the source file just before/after each saving to disk.

2. Avoid lines longer than 80 characters but don't be too passionate in this regard. The preferred way to deal with too long statements is to divide them sensibly into two or more new statements. However, avoid split the long statements by simply moving its non-fitting part to the next line. It's better to let the long line wrap naturally (especially in case of long `if` statement). The right length ruler is below.
